## Contents of the Bag

- SAO Components
- Hacker Summer Camp sticker
- DC32 Engage sticker
- Make a Hackin sticker
- DC32 Flipboard sticker
- Googly eyes

## Components for Assembly

- Hacker Summer Camp circuit board
- 4 RGB LEDs
- 1 resistor
- 1 SAO connector

## Assembly Order

1. Resistor
2. LEDs
3. SAO connector

## Step-by-Step Assembly Instructions

### Resistor

1. Insert the resistor from the front of the board.
2. Bend the legs slightly to hold it in place.
3. Solder the legs to the pad.
4. Use flush cutters to clip the legs, holding them to prevent flying debris.

### LEDs

1. Insert LEDs from the front, ensuring the long leg goes into the "long leg" hole and the short leg into the "short leg" hole.
2. Ensure the LED is flush with the board surface before soldering.
3. Solder the legs in place.
4. Clip the legs with flush cutters.

### SAO Connector

1. Insert the SAO connector from the back of the board.
2. Solder from the front, starting with one pin to hold it in place.
3. Adjust the alignment if necessary.
4. Solder the remaining pins, ensuring no bridging occurs.

## Final Assembly Check

- Ensure all solder joints are solid and there are no bridges between pins.
- Confirm that the resistor and LEDs are correctly positioned and soldered.

## Testing the SAO

1. Use a badge simulator with an SAO port to test the assembled SAO.
2. Insert the SAO into the port, ensuring proper orientation (notch alignment).
3. The SAO should light up using the badgeâ€™s power, displaying slow-changing RGB LEDs.
